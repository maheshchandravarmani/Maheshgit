GitHub is an online software development platform. It's used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects.

It makes it easy for developers to share code files and collaborate with fellow developers on open-source projects. GitHub also serves as a social networking site where developers can openly network, collaborate, and pitch their work.
GitHub users create accounts, upload files, and create coding projects. But the real work of GitHub happens when users begin to collaborate.

While anyone can code independently, teams of people build most development projects. Sometimes these teams are all in one place at once time, but more often they work asynchronously. There are many challenges to creating collaborative projects with distributed teams. GitHub makes this process much simpler in a few different ways.
