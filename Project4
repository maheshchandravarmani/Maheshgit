You'll also have a burgeoning Java portfolio that's packed full of interesting and practical Java projects, each demonstrating your dedication and abilities.

I also hope you enjoyed following along with my step-by-step tutorial on the first three Java projects!

My motivation with these Java tutorials is to guide you through the nuances of Java development while also giving you hands-on experience that you'd usually only get when taking a Java course.

Here at hackr.io, we're huge fans of project-based learning, so I hope these Java projects have bolstered your confidence and sparked a deeper interest in web development or any other form of Java development.
